# Offers Camp

> Search credit card merchant offers across multiple banks — powered by **Tampermonkey + Node.js + React**.

---

## ✨ What is this?

This project is a **personal / private tool** that helps you:

- Collect merchant offers from **multiple credit card portals** (e.g. Amex, Chase, Citi)
- Normalize all offers into a **single backend**
- Browse and search all collected offers from **one web UI**
- Avoid repeatedly logging into every bank just to check offers

**Core idea**

> **Tampermonkey reads what you already see → backend stores it → frontend lets you search it.**
